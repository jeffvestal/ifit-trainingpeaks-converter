# ifit-trainingpeaks-converter
Convert iFit workout csv to Training Peaks compatible csv

### iFit File
Export a workout from iFit web interface, select CSV -> No Incline

### Running
run `./ifit-trainingpeaks-converter <workout.csv>`

Ouputs <workout-converted.csv> with headers compatible to import into TrainingPeaks 


### Note
This is a quick dirty script with no error handling but iFit is a horrible backend so better than nothing
